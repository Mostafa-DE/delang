## During Loop (Continued)

<br />

You can do infinite loops by using `during true` or `during 1`. You can also use `during false` or `during 0` to do no loops at all.

<br />

But be careful, if you do an infinite loop, you will have to use `break` to exit the loop. Otherwise, your program will never finish executing. If you do no loops at all, your program will not execute any code inside the loop body.

<br />

**Note:** Due to the playground's time limit, you will not be able to run the code more that 7 seconds. So if you do an infinite loop, you will get a timeout error.

<br />

See the examples in the editor for more details.
