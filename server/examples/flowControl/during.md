## During Loop

<br />

The `during` loop is used to execute a block of code while a **certain condition is met**.

<br />

The `during` loop is defined with the following syntax:

- `during` : This is a keyword that **initiates** a loop. It indicates the start of a loop that **will continue** as long as the specified condition is `true`.
- `x < 5` : This is the **condition** that defines how long the loop will continue. In this case, it means the loop will keep executing as long as the variable x is less than `5`.
- `{ ... }` : The curly braces `{}` enclose the code block that you want to run during each iteration of the loop.

<br />

The `during` loop will **repeatedly execute** the code within its body as long as the condition `x < 5` remains `true`. Once the **condition** becomes false, the loop will **exit**, and the program will continue executing code outside of the loop body.
