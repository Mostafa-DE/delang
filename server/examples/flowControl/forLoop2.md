## For Loop (Continued)

<br />

Sometimes you don't want the `idx` or `num` variables to be assigned you can ignore them by using an underscore `_` in place of the variable name.

<br />

**Becareful** when using the underscore `_` as a variable name. It is a **special variable** that is used to ignore the value of the variable. If you use it as a variable name, you will not be able to access the value of the variable.

<br />

Also you have to put the underscore `_` for any ignored variable in the loop. If you don't, you will get an error.
