## Break the flow

<br />

This example shows how to break the flow of a program. The `break` statement is used to break out of a loop. It can be used to stop the loop when a **certain condition is met**.

<br />

In this example, the `break` statement is used to stop the loop when the value of `num` is equal to `3`. The loop will continue to iterate until the value of `num` is equal to `3`, at which point the loop will stop.

The `break` statement can also be used to stop a loop when a **certain condition is not met**. In this example, the `break` statement is used to stop the loop when the value of `num` is not equal to `3`. The loop will continue to iterate until the value of `num` is not equal to `3`, at which point the loop will stop.
