## Skip statement

<br />

The `skip` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop. It can be used to skip the current iteration when a **certain condition is met**.

<br />

In this example, the `skip` statement is used to skip the current iteration when the value of `num` is equal to `3`. The loop will continue to iterate until the value of `num` is equal to `3`, at which point the loop will skip the current iteration.

<br />

If the `skip` statement is used in a loop anything after the `skip` statement **will not be executed**. In this example, the `logs` statement after the skip statement will not be executed.
