## For Loop

<br />

**For loops** are used to iterate over a given sequence. On each iteration, the variable defined in the for loop will be assigned to the next value in the sequence. The for loop will continue to iterate until the sequence is exhausted.

<br />

`for` loops are defined with the following syntax:

- `for` : This keyword **initiates** the for loop.
- `idx` and `num` : These are loop variables. `idx` is used to represent the **index** or **key**, and `num` represents the **value** of each item in the numbers collection.
- `in` : The `in` keyword is used to specify the **collection** or **iterable** you want to loop through, in this case, the numbers collection.
- `numbers` : This is the collection or iterable you want to iterate over. It could be an **array**, a **string**, or any **iterable** object.
- `:` : The **colon** denotes the start of the loop body, which is indented and placed within curly braces.
- `{ ... }` : The curly braces `{}` contain the code that you want to execute in each iteration of the loop.
