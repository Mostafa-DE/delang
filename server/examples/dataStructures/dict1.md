### Dictionary (Hash Table)

<br />

In the DE language, the mapping type, often referred to as a `dictionary` or `hash` is a versatile and fundamental data structure. It allows you to store and manage key-value pairs, associating unique keys with corresponding values. This data structure is immensely valuable for tasks that involve looking up values based on specific keys, such as creating data structures, implementing efficient search algorithms, and organizing information.

<br />

You can define a dictionary in DE by binding a variable to a dictionary literal, which is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. You can create an empty dictionary by using an empty dictionary literal, which is just a pair of curly braces with nothing in between them.

<br />

You can create nested dictionaries by using a dictionary literal as a value for a key in another dictionary.
