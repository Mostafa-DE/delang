### Arrays

<br />

Arrays are custom-designed data structures that enable you to store collections of elements, such as `numbers`, `strings`, or even `custom data types`. Elements within DE arrays are ordered and can be accessed using index positions, much like other programming languages.

<br />

You can define an array in DE by binding a variable to an array literal, which is a comma-separated list of values enclosed in square brackets.

<br />

You can create an empty array by using an empty array literal, which is just a pair of square brackets with nothing in between them. You also can create nested arrays to create multi-dimensional arrays.
