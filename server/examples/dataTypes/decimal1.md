### Numeric Types (decimal)

<br />

**Decimals** are used when high precision for decimal numbers is required, especially in **financial** or **scientific** calculations where rounding errors can have significant consequences. Unlike **floats**, **decimals** provide a fixed and exact representation of decimal numbers. They are less prone to rounding errors and are suitable for situations where accuracy is paramount.

But what if we want to **control** the **precision** of the digits, let’s say we want to round the number to be 2 digits. Go to the next slide to see how to do that.
