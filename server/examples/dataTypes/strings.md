### String Data Type (str)

<br />

Strings are a sequence of characters. They are used to represent text based data. Strings are immutable, which means once they are created, their values cannot be changed.

<br />

### Creating Strings

Strings can be created by enclosing characters inside double quotes `"` or single quotes `'`. Even though both ways are correct, it is recommended to use double quotes `"`.

<br />

Take a look at top right code editor. The first line creates a string using double quotes `"` and the second line creates a string using single quotes `'`. Both of these strings are equivalent.

<br />

Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator. The `+` operator is used to add two numbers, but when used on strings, it concatenates them. For example, `"Hello" + "World"` will return `"HelloWorld"`.

<br />

The `+` operator can also be used to concatenate a string with a number. For example, `"Hello" + 1` will return `"Hello1"`.
