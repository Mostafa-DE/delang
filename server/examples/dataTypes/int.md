### Numeric Types (int64)

<br />

**Integers** are whole numbers without any fractional or decimal parts. They can be either positive, negative, or zero. Integers are typically used when precision to the decimal point is not required.

<br />

In many programming languages, integers have a fixed range, meaning they can only represent values within a specific range, and attempting to store a value outside that range can lead to overflow or underflow.

<br />

In **DE** Integer numbers are represented as int64 type in Go and the range starts from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`.
