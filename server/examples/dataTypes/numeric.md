### What are Numeric Types?

<br />

Numeric types are used to represent numbers. There are 3 numeric types available in DE. They are:

- **int64** - Used to represent whole numbers (positive and negative) with no decimal point. For example: 1, 2, -1, -2

- **float64** - Used to represent numbers with a decimal point. For example: 1.0, 2.0, -1.0, -2.0

- **decimal** - Used to represent numbers with a decimal point. For example: 1.0, 2.0, -1.0, -2.0

<br />

**Note:** The **decimal** type is a special type that we will discuss in more detail later.
