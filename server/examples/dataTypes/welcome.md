### What are Data Types?

<br />

Data types are the building blocks of DE. They are the basic types of data that DE can understand. They are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. For example, if you want to store a number in a variable, you would use the number data type. If you want to store a string in a variable, you would use the string data type.
