### Mapping Type (dict)

<br />

In the **DE** language, the mapping type, often referred to as a **dictionary** or **hash** is a versatile and fundamental data structure. It allows you to store and manage `key-value` pairs, associating unique keys with corresponding values. This data structure is immensely valuable for tasks that involve looking up values based on specific keys, such as creating **data structures**, implementing efficient **search algorithms**, and **organizing information**.

We will cover the **dict** data type in the **Data Structures** section.
