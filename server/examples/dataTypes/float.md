### Numeric Types (float64)

<br />

**Floating-point** numbers, often referred to simply as **floats**, are used when precision to the decimal point is necessary. Floats can represent real numbers, including integers, with a fractional part. They are expressed using a decimal point, or in scientific notation. However, it's important to note that floats are `approximations`, and they may not always represent exact values due to the way they are stored in the computer's memory.
