### Closures

<br />

**Closures** are a fundamental concept in **DE** that enable functions to `remember` and `access` variables from their containing scope even after that scope has exited. This behaviour allows for powerful and flexible coding patterns.

<br />

In simple terms, a **closure** is a function that has access to the parent scope, even after the scope has closed.
