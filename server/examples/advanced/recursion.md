### Recursions

<br />

`Recursion` is a technique for **iterating** over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result. Most loops can be rewritten in a recursive style, and in some functional languages this approach to looping is the default.

<br />

At the heart of recursion lies the concept of self-reference. A `recursive function` calls itself with **modified** arguments to solve a part of the problem. This process **continues** until a base case is reached, which is a condition that terminates the recursive calls.
