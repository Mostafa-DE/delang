### Self Invoking Functions

<br />

Self invoking functions are functions that are executed automatically when you define them. They are also called **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions** or **IIFEs**.

<br />

One of the most common uses of self invoking functions is to create a **private scope** for your code. This is useful when you want to avoid polluting the global scope with variables and functions.
