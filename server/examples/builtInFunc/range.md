### Range Function

<br />

The `range()` function returns a `list` of numbers. You can use the `range()` function to create a `list` of numbers before performing an operation on it.

<br />

You can pass any `number` to the `range()` function. The function will return a `list` of numbers from `1` to the number you passed in.

<br />

You can also pass two `numbers` to the `range()` function. The function will return a `list` of numbers from the first number to the second number. The first number must be less than the second number.

<br />

**Note** - The second number is included in the `list` of numbers returned by the `range()` function.
