## Variables

<br />

In DE, variables are like containers that hold information. When you first make a variable, you also give it a value.

<br />

Here are some important things to know about DE variables:

- Variable names can have **letters**, **numbers**, and **underscores**, but they have to start with a **letter** or **underscore**.
- DE is picky about **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters in variable names. You can't use special words as variable names.
- DE has two types of variables: **Mutable** and **Immutable**. **Mutable** ones can change once you've made them, while **Immutable** ones stay the same.
- To create a **Mutable** variable, you use the `let` keyword. For an **Immutable** variable, you use the `const` keyword.

<br />

Look at the code on the right. `x` is a **Mutable** variable, which means you can change its value. But `y` is an **Immutable** variable, so once you set its value, it can't be changed.
