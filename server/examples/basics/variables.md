## Variables

<br />

Variables are used to store values. When creating a variable for the first time it is assigned a value.

<br />

The variable name can contain `letters`, `digits`, `underscores`. It must start with a `letter` or an `underscore`.
And it is case sensitive. But it can't be a keyword.

<br />

There are two types of variables in DE: `Mutable` and `Immutable`.
<br/>
The `Mutable` variables can be changed after they are created. The `Immutable` variables can't be changed after they are created.

<br />

The `Mutable` variables are created with the `let` keyword. The `Immutable` variables are created with the `const` keyword.

<br />

See the code on the right. The variable `x` is a `Mutable` variable. The variable `y` is an `Immutable` variable. We can change the value of `x`, but we can't change the value of `y`.
