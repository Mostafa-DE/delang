# Functions

<br />

Functions are the main building blocks of a program. They allow code to be reused and organized in a logical way. Functions are defined using the `fun` keyword followed by the **function name** and a list of **parameters**. The function **body** is enclosed in curly braces.

<br />

A function can take zero or more arguments. The arguments are specified in the function definition, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.

<br />

Here's an example of the add function that takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns their sum.

<br />

Notice that the function body is enclosed in curly braces. Also the `return` keyword is used to return a value from the function.

<br />

To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, you can store it in a variable.
