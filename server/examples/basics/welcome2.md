# Hello World!

<br />

Like any other language, the first thing we are going to do is print "Hello World!" to the screen. In DE, we do this using the `logs` statement.

<br />

`logs` is a built-in function that prints the value of its argument to the screen. In this case, the argument is the string `"Hello World!"`.

<br />

To run the code, click on the **Run** button in the top middle of the screen. You should see the output of the program in the **Logs** section on the right below the code editor.

<br />

**Congratulations!** You just wrote your first DE program!
