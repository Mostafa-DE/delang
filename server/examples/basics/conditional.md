## Conditional Statements

<br />

In DE, `if` and `else` statements help your program make decisions. Here's how they work in simple terms:

- `if` statements let your program do something only if a certain condition is `true`. For example, **if it's sunny,** you might **go for a walk.**
- `else` statements come after `if` and provide an alternative action if the condition in the `if` statement is not `true`. For example, **if it's not sunny,** you might **stay inside and code.**
- `if` and `else` statements help your program make choices and do different things based on those choices.

<br />

Look at the code on the right. The `if` statement checks if the weather is sunny. If it is, the program will print **Go for a walk!** If it's not sunny, the program will print **Stay inside and code!.**
