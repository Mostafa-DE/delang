### The DE Playground: A Simple Overview

<br />

The DE Playground is a web-based DE environment that lets you write DE code and see the results immediately, without needing to install anything.

<br/>

The playground is ideal for experimenting with DE code, debugging code, and sharing DE code snippets.

<br />

The playground is created using [Go](https://golang.org/) and [SolidJs](https://www.solidjs.com/). Here's how it works: You write your code in the playground, and the server takes that code, runs it, and then sends the results back to you.

<br />

However, there are some limitations to keep in mind:

The server has a time limit of **7 seconds**. If your program takes **longer than 7 seconds** to run, the server will stop it and report an error."
