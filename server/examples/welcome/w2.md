<!-- ## Hello World

<br />

Here's how to display `Hello World` in the console.
It's a simple and direct process.

<br/>

The `logs` function is a built-in feature for console output, and it always returns null.

<br/>

Also you can also use the `+` operator to combine strings.

<br />

We will cover more about the `logs` function in the built-in functions section ðŸ˜Š. -->
